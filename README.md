# Instagram Chatbot Integration with CSV-Based Conditions

This project is a Flask-based application that integrates with the Instagram Graph API to create a highly flexible chatbot. The chatbot uses a CSV file to define keyword-based conditions and returns one or more responses (plain text or button messages) depending on the incoming Instagram message. It mimics ManyChatâ€™s behavior by evaluating multiple conditions and sending multiple messages if needed.

## Features

- **CSV-Based Rule Engine:**  
  Define conditions in a CSV file using:
  - `contains_all`: All listed keywords must be present in the incoming message.
  - `contains_any`: At least one of the listed keywords must be present.
  - `does_not_contain`: None of the listed keywords should be present.
  
- **Multiple Response Types:**  
  Send plain text responses or rich messages with buttons (using JSON format).

- **Multi-Response Capability:**  
  If an incoming message matches more than one rule, all corresponding responses are sent.

- **Instagram Integration:**  
  Uses the Instagram Graph API to both receive messages (via webhook) and send responses.
