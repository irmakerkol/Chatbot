# Instagram Chatbot Integration with CSV-Based Conditions

This project is a Flask-based application that integrates with the Instagram Graph API to create a highly flexible chatbot. The chatbot uses a CSV file to define keyword-based conditions and returns one or more responses (plain text or button messages) depending on the incoming Instagram message. It mimics ManyChatâ€™s behavior by evaluating multiple conditions and sending multiple messages if needed.

## Features

- **CSV-Based Rule Engine:**  
  Define conditions in a CSV file using:
  - `contains_all`: All listed keywords must be present in the incoming message.
  - `contains_any`: At least one of the listed keywords must be present.
  - `does_not_contain`: None of the listed keywords should be present.
  
- **Multiple Response Types:**  
  Send plain text responses or rich messages with buttons (using JSON format).

- **Multi-Response Capability:**  
  If an incoming message matches more than one rule, all corresponding responses are sent.

- **Instagram Integration:**  
  Uses the Instagram Graph API to both receive messages (via webhook) and send responses.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/)
- [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv) (for loading environment variables)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/irmakerkol/Instagram-Chatbot
   cd instagram-chatbot
   
2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Set Environment Variables:**

   Create a .env file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

   ```dotenv
   # Instagram API Credentials
    PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN
    VERIFY_TOKEN=YOUR_VERIFY_TOKEN
    
    # Optional: Specify a custom CSV file path if not using the default 'conditions.csv'
    CONDITIONS_CSV=conditions.csv
    
    # Optional: Specify the port on which the application will run (default is 5000)
    PORT=5000

   
4. **Create a CSV file:**
    (default: conditions.csv) with the following columns:

    `contains_all:` Semicolon-separated list of keywords that must all be present.

    `contains_any:` Semicolon-separated list of keywords where at least one must be present.

    `does_not_contain:` Semicolon-separated list of keywords that must not be present.

    `response_type:` The type of response (text for plain text, buttons for button messages).

    `response_content:` For text, this is the message string; for buttons, this is a JSON string defining the button structure.


## Running the Application

  1. **Start the Flask Application:**

     ```bash
     python ig_chatbot.py
     
  2. **Configure the Instagram Webhook:**
     In your Facebook Developer dashboard, set the webhook URL (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/webhook) for your Instagram Business Account.
     During verification, Instagram will send a GET request with hub.challenge and hub.verify_token.
     The app will return the challenge token if the VERIFY_TOKEN matches.

## How it Works
  Webhook Verification:
  Instagram sends a GET request for webhook verification. The app checks the provided verify token and returns the challenge if it matches.
  
  Message Processing:
  Incoming Instagram messages (found in the entry and messaging fields) are processed by comparing the message text against all rules defined in the CSV file.
  
  Response Sending:
  For every rule that matches, the app sends the corresponding response via the Instagram Graph API. If multiple rules match, multiple responses are sent.
